# ReinforcementLearningFSharp
Implementation of algorithms and exercises from Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement Learning book](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book.html) in F#.

The implementation is primarily for the first edition of the book (see [here](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/code/code.html) for the original Common Lisp and MATLAB codes). It was developed primarily using [FsLab](http://www.fslab.org)'s basic template.

## Initial setup on Linux
* Install [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) and [F#](http://fsharp.org/use/linux/)
* Run `mono .paket/paket.bootstrapper.exe`
* Run `mono .paket/paket.exe install`
